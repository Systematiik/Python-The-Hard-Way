#ex1
> print()
print is used to print statements
example: print("Hello World!")

#ex2
> #
The number sign is used to create comments

#ex3
> you can do math in print statements
example: print("5 + 8 = ", 5 + 8)
 output: 13

#ex4
> setting numbers to variables
example: number_of_cars = 5

#ex5
> setting strings and math to variables
examples: name = 'Jeremy'
          addition = 5 + 7

#ex6
> ability to print variables in a print()
example (1): hello = 'hello'
print(f"{hello} world!")
    or
print(hello, " world!")

#ex7
> escape sequence such as end=' ' in print statements
there are escape statements to break print statements

#ex8
> the use of functions such as .format()
example: format() is used to allow the user to display variables in a print in {}
         formatter = '{}'
         print(formatter.format(2))
    output = 2

#ex9
> more escape sequences
examples: \n \t \r

#ex10
> applying strings with escape sequences and calling them in print statements
example: hw = "hello\nworld!"
         print(hw)

#ex11
> introduction to input()
example: age = input()
         #this asks for input for the variable age

#ex12
> shows you how to use input() to ask a question without print
example: age = input("How old are you? ")

#ex13
> introduction to argv
> take arguments in terminal to execute
example: from sys import argv
         script, first = argv

#ex14
> combination of argv and inputs
> asking the user for arguments, then inputs for further input

#ex15
> introduction to opening files
> open(), read()

#ex16
> opening files with argv
> open, truncate, and write to a file

#ex17
> copying the contents of one text file to another

#ex18
> introduction to def
> using methods to create mini scripts

#ex19
> using math in methods

#ex20
> using methods to print a whole text file
> start the file from the very first byte
> print each line seperately with a counter incrementing by 1

#ex21
> using math in methods to display what gets executed first
example: what = add(age, subtract(height, multiply(weight, divide(iq,2))))
